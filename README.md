## TempBot

#### About:

TempBot is a Discord bot that can display hardware information of the machine
that it's running on. I created TempBot for a friend who needed to see the
temperature that the CPUs on his server were running at from his phone.

TempBot can display:
- CPU Usage and Temperature.
- GPU Temperature.
- Ram Usage.
- Disk Read and Write Rates.

#### Requirements:

TempBot requires Open Hardware Monitor running in the background to receive
most of it's information. TempBot does not need administrative privileges to
function. TempBot functions only on Windows.
